# disSys_projs
This repository demonstrates a distributed system project incorporating various communication models and technologies. It includes a RESTful API server built in Golang, with client applications developed in C++ and Python for seamless interaction. Additionally, a gRPC-based server-client model is presented alongside a TCP socket communication setup to illustrate efficient client-server communication. Lastly, using ZooKeeper, Kafka, and Docker, this project simulates a distributed system environment, enabling real-time background statistics on shopping orders by leveraging data storage and processing across multiple nodes.
